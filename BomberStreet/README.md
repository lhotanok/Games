`WinForms`

Place bomb on the play ground using `space` key and destroy your enemies! You can collect various items that appear on the screen randomly and use them to help you increase your bombing power. These perks can help you place multiple bombs at once, make the bomb detonation more deadly, protect yourself from the next detonation or enemy running into you and get other useful tricks. Try them all to see for yourself. But keep in mind they expire after their time limit exceeds.

This game is strongly inspired by the existing game Bomb It. It was created as a final project for introduction in C# programming. Full conversion into English planned.
